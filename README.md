Dog Breed Classifier

A deep learning project that classifies dog breeds from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained on image datasets and can predict the breed of a dog with good accuracy.

📌 Features

Image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Data preprocessing and augmentation for better results

Training and evaluation with accuracy/loss graphs

Simple prediction script to classify new dog images

⚙️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Frameworks/Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn

Other Tools: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📊 Dataset

Dataset used: Kaggle Dog Breed Dataset

Contains thousands of labeled images across multiple dog breeds
