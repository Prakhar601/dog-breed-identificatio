Dog-breed-identification

Overview:
This project is a deep learning model that identifies dog breeds from images. I built it using TensorFlow/Keras in a Jupyter Notebook. It’s mainly a Kaggle-style notebook project, focusing on training a CNN on a dataset of dog images and testing its predictions.

Project Structure:

    dog-breed-identification/

    ├── code.ipynb         # Jupyter Notebook with model training and evaluation
    ├── README.md          # Project documentation

How to Run:-

    1.Clone the repo:
      git clone https://github.com/Prakhar601/dog-breed-identificatio.git
      cd dog-breed-identificatio

    2.Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    3. Open the notebook in Colab or locally:
      Jupyter Notebook code.ipynb

    4. Run the cells to train the model or test predictions

What the Project Does:-

	•	Loads dog images from the dataset.
	•	Preprocesses them (resizing, normalization).
	•	Trains a CNN model to classify the images by breed.
	•	Evaluates accuracy and visualizes results.
	•	Can be extended to real-time predictions in Colab.

Tech Stack:-

    •	Python
	•	TensorFlow / Keras
	•	NumPy, Pandas
	•	Matplotlib / Seaborn
